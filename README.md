# Optimizing Delivery Truck Routes Using Simulated Annealing

## Overview
This project aims to optimize delivery truck routes using the simulated annealing algorithm. Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function, which makes it well-suited for solving complex optimization problems like the traveling salesman problem (TSP).

## Features
• Simulated Annealing Algorithm: Efficiently finds near-optimal solutions for the DTR.
• Customizable Parameters: Easily adjust the algorithm parameters to experiment with different settings.
• Visualization: Provides visual representation of the routes and their optimization process.
## Getting Started
• Prerequisites
   •Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
